The Ant and the Grasshopper

The Cicada, having sung
Throughout the summer,
Was greatly lacking
When the north wind came
Not one little bit
Fly or worm.
She went begging
In the Ant its neighbor
Begging her to lend him
Some grain to survive
Until the new season.
I'll pay you, 'she said,
Before Out of animal faith,
Interest and principal.
Ant is not lending:
This is his slightest defect.
What were you doing in hot weather?
She said to this borrower.
Day and night to all comers
I sang, if you please.
You sing? I am very comfortable.
Well! dance now.
